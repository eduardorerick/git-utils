# git-utils
Scripts made to automate some commands I use a lot on github

## Installation

The best way to use it is to create an `alias` of the script you want to use in `~/bashrc` or `~/zhsrc`
for example

    alias script_alias="~/script.sh"

And then run in terminal

    ./script_alias
  
And it's ready to use!
